# (WIP) shyDrugs
ESX Drugs run script for Fivem Roleplay servers<br>

This script features a run-like system, where the drug seller (player) has to interact with a main dealer, to get locations of his subdealers. The player then has to drive to those subdealers, to sell a configurable amount of drugs there. After the sale, the player can either choose to continue the run or to stop selling drugs. <br>

A configurable option is also to alert people with certain jobs (police, or gangs) of the deal. In a configurable probability of occasionality, a phone message is sent to the configured jobs.

# Performance:
0.01ms when standing within 2 meters of the NPC, for the rest 0.00ms <br>

# Dependencies:
As of right now, the script is a work-in-progress and thus is not really configurable yet. If you don't have one of the requirements, you'll have to modify the script in order for it to work. Feel free to open an issue if you need help adjusting the script. <br>
- es_extended <br>
- ox_lib & ox_inventory <br>
- lb_phone <br>

Feel free to recommend me updates, or to leave some constructive criticism. Would love that.<br>
